# Debug GitHub Hosted Runner through an SSH Gateway

This repository enables SSH access to GitHub-hosted runners using a Docker-based SSH gateway and reverse SSH tunnels.

## Architecture

GitHub-hosted runners cannot accept inbound SSH connections. The solution uses a **reverse SSH tunnel**:

1. **Gateway Server** (Docker container) - SSH server on your local machine
2. **GitHub Runner** - Connects to gateway with reverse tunnel: `-R 2222:localhost:22`
3. **You** - SSH to gateway port 2222, which tunnels through to the GitHub runner

```
Your Machine → ssh gateway:2222 → (reverse tunnel) → GitHub Runner:22
```

## Setup

### 1. Start the Docker Gateway

```bash
# Build and start the gateway container
docker compose up --build -d

# Verify it's running
docker compose ps
docker compose logs -f gateway
```

The gateway will listen on:
- **Port 50556** - Gateway SSH (for GitHub runner to connect)
- **Port 2222** - Reverse tunnel endpoint (for you to connect to runner)

### 2. Configure Router Port Forwarding

For GitHub runners and your connections to reach the gateway, expose both ports:

1. Find your local IP: `ip addr show | grep "inet "`
2. Configure your router to forward both ports:
   - External Port: **50556** → Internal IP: **[your-local-ip]** → Internal Port: **50556** (for GitHub runner to connect)
   - External Port: **2222** → Internal IP: **[your-local-ip]** → Internal Port: **2222** (for you to connect to runner)
3. Get your public IP: `curl icanhazip.com`

### 3. Set Up GitHub Secrets

In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions** → **New repository secret**:

| Secret Name | Value | Example |
|------------|-------|---------|
| `GATEWAY_PRIVATE_KEY` | Contents of `test-assets/id_rsa_test` | Entire file including BEGIN/END lines |
| `GATEWAY_HOST` | Your public IP address | `123.45.67.89` |
| `GATEWAY_PORT` | Gateway SSH port | `50556` |
| `GATEWAY_USER` | Gateway username | `gateway` |

**To get the private key:**
```bash
cat test-assets/id_rsa_test
# Copy the entire output including -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
```

### 4. Run the GitHub Actions Workflow

Drop `debug-runner.yml` into `.github/workflows/`. (Optionally add your custom steps into the placeholder section) 

1. Go to your repository → **Actions** → **SSH into GitHub Runner**
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Provide these inputs:
   - **SSH_PUBLIC_KEY**: Your local public key (e.g., `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) or use test key: `cat test-assets/id_rsa_test.pub`
   - **MAX_LIFETIME**: How long to keep tunnel open in seconds (default: 3600)
4. Click **Run workflow**

### 5. Connect to the GitHub Runner

Once the workflow shows "Tunnel is active!", connect:

```bash
# Generate and uising test key
bash ./test-assets/generate-keys.sh
ssh -i test-assets/id_rsa_test -p 2222 -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null runner@[YOUR_PUBLIC_IP]

# Using your own key (if you provided your own public key)
ssh -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -p 2222 runner@[YOUR_PUBLIC_IP]
```

You're now inside the GitHub-hosted runner!

## Testing the Gateway Locally

Test that the gateway is working before running the GitHub workflow:

```bash
# Connect to gateway user (not runner)
ssh -i test-assets/id_rsa_test -p 50556 -o IdentitiesOnly=yes gateway@localhost

# Expected output: Ubuntu shell as user "gateway"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection refused on port 50556
- Check gateway is running: `docker compose ps`
- Check router port forwarding is configured correctly
- Test externally: `ssh -i test-assets/id_rsa_test -p 50556 gateway@[YOUR_PUBLIC_IP]`

### Permission denied when connecting to runner
- Make sure you're using the correct private key (matching the public key you provided to the workflow)
- Check the workflow is still running (tunnel only exists while job is active)
- Connect to port **2222** not 50556: `ssh -p 2222 runner@...`

### Workflow tunnel fails to establish
- Verify GitHub Secrets are set correctly
- Check gateway logs: `docker logs debug-runner-gateway-1 --tail 50`
- Ensure `GATEWAY_PRIVATE_KEY` secret contains the entire key including BEGIN/END lines

## How It Works

1. **Gateway Container**: Runs OpenSSH server with `GatewayPorts yes` to allow reverse tunnels
2. **GitHub Workflow**: 
   - Installs SSH server on the GitHub runner
   - Adds your public key to runner's `authorized_keys`
   - Opens reverse tunnel: `ssh -R 2222:localhost:22 gateway@your-gateway`
   - Keeps job alive for MAX_LIFETIME seconds
3. **You Connect**: SSH to gateway's port 2222, which forwards through the tunnel to the runner

- `docker-compose.yml` - Gateway service with port mappings
- `authorized_keys` - Public keys authorized to connect to gateway

## Gateway Configuration

The SSH server is configured with:
- Port 50555 (internal) → 50556 (external host port)
- Port 2222 (reverse tunnel endpoint)
- `GatewayPorts yes` - Allows reverse tunnels
- `AllowTcpForwarding yes` - Enables TCP forwarding
- Public key authentication only (no passwords)
- User: `gateway`
